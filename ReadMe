WaveMamba is a frequency-aware state space network designed for image dehazing, specifically optimized for non-homogeneous haze scenarios. By leveraging a Learnable Lifting Wavelet Transform (LLWT), the model decomposes images into high- and low-frequency components, which are processed separately through a dual-path architecture. It restores global contrast and local details respectively, and dynamically integrates features via a density-aware fusion module to achieve high-quality image dehazing.
Core Innovations:
Learnable Lifting Wavelet Transform (LLWT): Adaptively decomposes frequency features to accurately separate haze-induced degradation patterns.
Dual-Path Enhancement Architecture: Combines SS2D Mamba (for long-range dependency modeling in the low-frequency path) and edge-enhanced convolution (for detail restoration in the high-frequency path).
Density-Aware Feature Fusion (DAFM): Dynamically adjusts feature fusion weights based on a predicted haze density mask, enabling adaptive restoration for non-homogeneous haze.
Adaptive Multi-Task Loss: Balances reconstruction loss, frequency consistency loss, and perceptual loss using Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for stable training.
